# Hash

Hash is a simple chat system designed to keep chats persistent, simple, hacker-friendly, and identity-flexible. 

A few things to consider when using Hash:

* A hash, is a chat room
* Anyone can join a hash, so naming your hash "myhash" might not be a good idea, something like "myHash4356c9"
* Hash names and Nicks are case sensitive, so a hash called "myhash4356c9" is different from "myHash4356c9"
* Nicks belong to no one
* Chats are persistent and cannot be erased except by someone who controls the database

Hash was created because I wanted something like IRC, persistent and easy like HipChat, open source, and based
on PHP, MySQL, HTML, and Javascript. Oh and **dead** simple!

# Installation

Clone this repo down and rename `config.php.sample` to `config.php` and populate with your values. Import
`db.sql` to your database and start hashing it out!

# Development

There is a VVV setup for developing Hash over at
